## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up the project locally for development or testing.

### Prerequisites

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (Version >= 18.0.0 recommended, as specified in `package.json`)
*   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (usually comes with Node.js)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/arjunbishnoi.com.git
    cd arjunbishnoi.com
    ```
    *(Replace `your-username` with your actual GitHub username)*

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Development Server

To run the website locally with hot-reloading for development:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) (or the port specified in the console) in your browser.

## üèóÔ∏è Building for Production

### Static Generation (SSG)

To build the application for static hosting (generates pre-rendered HTML files):

```bash
npm run generate
```

The output will be in the `.output/public` directory. You can deploy this folder to any static hosting service (like GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel).

### Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

To build the application with a Node.js server for SSR:

```bash
npm run build
```

The output will be in the `.output` directory. To start the production server:

```bash
npm run start
```
or
```bash
node .output/server/index.mjs
```

## üö¢ Deployment

This project includes configuration files that suggest potential deployment setups:

*   `deploy.sh`: A shell script likely used for automating deployment steps.
*   `nginx.conf`: Configuration for using Nginx as a reverse proxy or web server.
*   `arjunbishnoi.service`: A systemd service file, possibly for running the Node.js server on a Linux machine.
*   `setup-aws.sh`: A script suggesting deployment to AWS infrastructure.

Refer to these files or your hosting provider's documentation for specific deployment instructions.

## üßπ Code Quality

*   **Linting:** Check for code errors and style issues.
    ```bash
    npm run lint
    ```
*   **Linting & Fixing:** Automatically fix linting issues.
    ```bash
